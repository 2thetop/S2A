   A Scratch 2.0 Hardware Extension written in Python

Connect your Scratch creations to an Arduino UNO or Leonardo, without having to write one line of additional code!
Three demos are included:
    1. The obligatory "Blink the pin 13 LED - Arduino Hello World" (from Scratch of course!)
    2. CodeShield - display the data from all sensors and control each actuator from Scratch.
    3. A Scratch remix of the Simon memory game, using the Arduino to enter your guesses and to display the colors.
       A sample breadboard wiring layout is provided.
    
How is this all done without any additional user coding? Read the included documentation to find out.
